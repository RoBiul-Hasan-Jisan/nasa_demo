    color: "bg-gray-400",
    info:
      "Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in our solar system. It has a very thin atmosphere, experiences extreme temperature variations, and has a cratered, rocky surface similar to the Moon.",

    size: 16,
    distance: 90,
    color: "bg-yellow-400",
    info:
      "Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid. It is the hottest planet due to a runaway greenhouse effect, with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead.",

    distance: 120,
    color: "bg-blue-500",
    info:

    name: "Mars",
    size: 16,
    distance: 150,
    color: "bg-red-600",
    info:
      "Mars is known as the Red Planet because of iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It has the largest volcano and canyon in the solar system, a thin atmosphere mostly of carbon dioxide, and evidence of ancient water flows that suggest it may have once supported microbial life.",

    distance: 200,
    color: "bg-orange-500",
    info:
      "Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and a gas giant composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. It has a strong magnetic field and a famous Great Red Spot, a massive storm larger than Earth that has lasted for centuries.",

    distance: 250,
    color: "bg-yellow-300",
    info:
      "Saturn is renowned for its extensive ring system made mostly of ice and rock particles. It is a gas giant with a low density, composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, and has dozens of moons, including Titan, which has a thick atmosphere.",

    name: "Uranus",
    size: 24,
    distance: 290,
    color: "bg-cyan-400",
    info:
      "Uranus is an ice giant with a blue-green color caused by methane gas in its atmosphere. It rotates on its side, resulting in extreme seasonal changes. It has a faint ring system and a cold, icy interior.",

    distance: 330,
    color: "bg-blue-700",
    info:
      "Neptune is the farthest known planet from the Sun and is a cold, blue gas giant. It has strong winds—some of the fastest in the solar system—and a storm system similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot called the Great Dark Spot. It also has several moons, including Triton.",
